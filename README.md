# asteroids

This is a clone of Asteroids that I made in early 2013 as part of a University course. 

To toot my own horn for a moment, it earned me top of the class, and in the following year, top prize in a game development competition - which included a trophy and a sweet $700 AUD.

No guarantees that it still compiles just yet - I'll eventually get around to establishing a release process for the game.\
<small><small>Honestly, not even sure it works on Windows 10...</small></small>

Enjoy!\

## Building

Actually very unsure if it still builds - see [#1](https://github.com/spiltcoffee/asteroids/issues/1).

Will update this section if and when I know how.
